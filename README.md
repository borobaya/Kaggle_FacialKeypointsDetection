# Kaggle_FacialKeypointsDetection
First go at the "Facial Keypoints Detection" Kaggle competition

The scripts require the data files 'training.csv' and 'test.csv' and to be stored within the folder 'Data'. These can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/c/facial-keypoints-detection/data (Note that they need to be extracted).

The folder "Cache" also needs to be created in the same directory.
